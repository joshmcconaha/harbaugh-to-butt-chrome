harbaugh-to-butt
=============

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of ‘harbaugh’ with 'my butt'

Because Michigan fans can’t shut up about Jim Harbaugh, I copied the popular cloud-to-butt Chrome extension and replaced “the cloud” with “Harbaugh.”  You’re welcome, America. 

The idea came from this /r/cfb thread:  https://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/2z1qp4/adblock_feature_request_deharbaugh/ 


Installation
------------

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions.  Drag Harbaugh-To-Butt.crx into the page that appears.

Non-Chrome Browsers
------------

Your’e on your own.  cloud-for-butt has versions for other browsers.  Go to GitHub, download the zip, then find and replace “cloud” with “Harbaugh.”
